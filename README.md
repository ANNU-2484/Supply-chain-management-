>The analysis reveals that while the supply chain is performing efficiently in areas like inventory turnover and sales fulfillment, there are notable gaps that need addressing. The low warehouse utilization rate suggests potential inefficiencies in space planning and logistics. High transportation costs in the North region and longer lead times for accessories point to the need for more streamlined and responsive supply chain operations. Additionally, the presence of a significant number of pending and canceled orders indicates room for improvement in inventory availability and order processing. Optimizing warehouse space, balancing inventory across regions, and reducing lead times—especially for specific product categories—can significantly enhance overall supply chain effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
